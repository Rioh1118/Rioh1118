-🧑🏻‍🔬  I have been actively working with a clear goal of acquiring a broad range of IT knowledge. At university, I am mainly studying statistics, coding theory(abstract mathematics), multimedia programming with Python, and the implementation of TCP/IP and UDP using Java.


### University Studies

**First Year:**
- In my first year at university, I learned C language.
- I studied the basics of data formats such as stack and heap, references and copies, and ASCII.
- I implemented fundamental data structures in C, including linked lists, binary trees, heaps, stacks, queues, and hash tables.

**Second Year:**
- In my second year, I studied Java.
- I learned about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and had assignments to create GUI applications using JavaFX.
- I implemented simple games like Pac-Man and Othello.
- Additionally, I learned about multithreading and implemented merge sort using multiple threads.

**Third Year:**
- In my third year, I worked with Python to visualize and transform audio, binarize images, and apply similar processing to videos.
- The courses utilized libraries such as NumPy, LibROSA, and OpenCV.
