**`Third-year student at university of science`**

I'm student aspiring to become engineer(frontend/backend/infrastracture).
Almost all of the project for my skill development.

-üßëüèª‚Äçüî¨  I have been actively working with a clear goal of acquiring a broad range of IT knowledge. At university, I am mainly studying statistics, coding theory(abstract mathematics), multimedia programming with Python, and the implementation of TCP/IP and UDP using Java.


### University Studies

**First Year:**
- In my first year at university, I learned C language.
- I studied the basics of data formats such as stack and heap, references and copies, and ASCII.
- I implemented fundamental data structures in C, including linked lists, binary trees, heaps, stacks, queues, and hash tables.

**Second Year:**
- In my second year, I studied Java.
- I learned about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and had assignments to create GUI applications using JavaFX.
- I implemented simple games like Pac-Man and Othello.
- Additionally, I learned about multithreading and implemented merge sort using multiple threads.

**Third Year:**
- In my third year, I worked with Python to visualize and transform audio, binarize images, and apply similar processing to videos.
- The courses utilized libraries such as NumPy, Librosa, and OpenCV.

### Self-Study

I have been actively working with a clear goal of acquiring a broad range of IT knowledge.

**Data Science:**
- I developed an interest in data science and studied visualization in Python using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib through books.
- During this time, I studied supervised learning and used libraries to perform multiple regression analysis to predict bento sales from weather and date-time data, and logistic regression to predict whether a patient had cancer based on physical data.
- Later, I took Andrew Ng's machine learning and deep learning courses on Coursera, implemented supervised learning entirely in NumPy, and covered mathematical topics such as learning rate and regularization intuition. I also implemented simple Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks to solve image classification problems.

**Web Development:**
- I learned about web technologies through Coursera's IBM Full Stack Engineer course.
- This course covered general web topics such as how a client requests to a DNS (and stores it in the cache), then sends a request to the returned IP address, accessing each server via a load balancer, and cloud technologies.
- I encountered React during this time, but since the course covered older and more complex concepts such as class components and Redux, I studied further through Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course.

**Golang and Rust:**
- Recently, I have been frequently using Golang because of its intuitive nature with goroutines and its fast execution speed.
- I also use Rust extensively because I appreciate its lightweight nature and ownership model. Although I struggle with its complex concepts, I am committed to mastering them.
- Backend technology is the topic I am most eager to learn. I have been designing websites using Adobe XD and Figma and starting projects, but I often struggle with backend concepts such as database design and URI structuring.
